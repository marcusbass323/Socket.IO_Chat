<h1>Socket IO Chat</h1>

<h2>This web-based chat was built with Node.js, jQuery, Bootstrap and Socket.IO.</h2>

<p>1- The user must initiate the chat by entering a username. All user parties
are notified of online status on the left area of the window.</p>

<p>2 - Either user can enter a mesage within the textarea field, which is sent
  through the server (which refreshes on change) and updated in HTML via the sendFile method. 
  An if statement is implemented to hide the login bar if there's data entered, and once 
  a user enter's data, they're allowed to send a message under their login name.
